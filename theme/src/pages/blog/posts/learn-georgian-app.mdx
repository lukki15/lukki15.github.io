Learning a language can be a challenging task, especially when it comes to lesser-known languages with a smaller number of native speakers.
This is the case with the Georgian language, which is spoken by only around four million people worldwide.
Despite its rich history and unique alphabet, finding quality learning app for Georgian can be quite a struggle.

When I began my journey of learning Georgian, I quickly realized that there was a significant lack of effective learning apps dedicated to this language.
The few options available were either incomplete or filled with frustrating advertisements. On the other hand,
the paid apps tended to be either too expensive for my budget or plagued with errors and inconsistencies.
Faced with these limitations, I made the decision to take matters into my own hands and create my own Georgian learning app.

The primary goal of my app is to provide comprehensive and engaging learning materials for anyone interested in mastering the Georgian language.
One of the key features is an interactive guide to learning the unique Georgian alphabet.
By utilizing animations, the app allows users to visualize the formation of each character, making it easier to grasp the intricate strokes and structures.
To enhance the learning experience, the app also provides an opportunity for users to practice writing and matching each character,
enabling them to develop a strong foundation in Georgian script.

Moreover, the app includes sections that focus on matching Georgian characters with their English equivalents.
This feature reinforces the association between the Georgian alphabet and its corresponding sounds, facilitating pronunciation skills.
Additionally, there are screens dedicated to vocabulary, where users can practice matching Georgian words with their translations.
This vocabulary feature serves as a valuable tool for building a basic understanding of the language and expanding one's Georgian lexicon.

In terms of design, I strived for a user-friendly interface that caters to learners of all levels, 
whether they are beginners or more advanced learners hoping to refine their Georgian skills.
The app's layout ensures easy navigation and accessibility, enabling users to explore different sections and track their progress effectively.
Furthermore, I have implemented features that allow users to customize their learning experience,
such as adjusting the difficulty level or focusing on specific topics of interest.
