C++ is a powerful programming language known for its versatility and extensive standard library.
However, one area where it lacks a standardized function is calculating the power of an integer.
While some languages provide this functionality out of the box, 
C++ does not offer a dedicated power function for integers in its standard library.
In this blog post, we will delve into the reasons behind this absence and explore alternative approaches to perform exponentiation on integers.

## Why is there no Integer Power Function in C++?

The absence of a dedicated integer power function in the C++ standard library may appear baffling at first,
especially since many other programming languages do include such functionality.
However, there are a few reasons behind this omission:

1. Simplicity: 
The C++ standard library focuses on providing essential building blocks rather than including advanced or specialized functionality. 
Calculating the power of an integer falls into the latter category, and thus was not included in the standard library to maintain simplicity.

1. Performance considerations:
Integer exponentiation can be a costly operation, particularly when dealing with large numbers.
Implementing it as a standard function would require considering different optimization techniques
and potentially lead to performance inconsistencies across different platforms.

## Implementation examples

### Simple implementation 
with `O(exp)` runtime:
```cpp
int ipow(int base, unsigned int exp){
    if(exponent == 0) return 1;
    if(exponent == 1) return base;
    return base * ipow(base, exp - 1);
}
```

### Optimization implementation
with `O(log(exp))` runtime;
```cpp
int ipow(int base, unsigned int exp){
    if(exp == 0) return 1;
    if(exp == 1) return base;

    int tmp = ipow(base, exp >> 1);
    if(exp % 2 == 0) return tmp * tmp;
    return base * tmp * tmp;
}
```
or in iterative style:
```cpp
int ipow(int base, unsigned int exp){
    int result = 1;
    while(true){
        if(exp & 1) result *= base;
        exp >>= 1;
        if(!exp) break;
        base *= base;
    }
    return result;
}
```

### At compile time
with `constexpr`:
```cpp
constexpr int ipow(int base, unsigned int exp){
    if(exp == 0) return 1;
    if(exp == 1) return base;

    int tmp = ipow(base, exp >> 1);
    if (exp % 2 == 0) return tmp * tmp;
    return base * tmp * tmp;
}
```

with template meta programming:
```cpp
template<typename T, T BASE, unsigned int EXP> struct ipow {
    constexpr static const T value = BASE * ipow<T, BASE, EXP-1>::value;
};

template<typename T, T BASE> struct ipow<T, BASE,0> {
    constexpr static const T value = 1;
};
```
